# Level 0: The Basic Board
Before diving into building your own e-board, it is vital that you understand the workings of a normal skateboard. Simply put, a skateboard is a plank of wood with 4 wheels attached to it that a person rides using their feet to guide and accelerate.

Skateboards consist of three primary parts: the deck, the trucks, and the wheels.
