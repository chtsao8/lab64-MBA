1. Built vanilla longboard. Assembly pretty simple. Trucks attached on top a flexible plate before the deck.
- Wheels have two slots for each bearing. One on each side of the wheel
2. Motor pulley did not fit on motor axle, despite both being 10mm shaft compatible.
- Make sure to buy compatible pieces next time.
- Had to drill into motor axle to make it wider
3. Wheel pulley did not fit perfectly into wheel.
- Only used 3 screws. Dangerous?
4. Wheel did not fit onto truck with wheel pulley.
- Used dremel to grind it down.
- still might rub
